# Open source at Floream

Floream is the UKâ€™s leading provider of online learning for professional qualifications and has recently begun a programme of international expansion. The Floream development team is responsible for the development and maintenance of the campus, exams, customer relationship management and other supporting systems within the business. Working with a number of internal customers requires a constant focus on reuse and extensibility across all of our design and development activities.

## Brief

Floream's strategy when approaching the development of new projects is to:

1. Prefer the use of Free and Open Source Software (FOSS), where appropriate, within our projects and contribute our changes to such projects to the open source community.
2. Perform our development activities in the open.
3. Where possible, and without infringing upon branding agreements, to publish all source code created by Floream, regardless of whether it was developed in-house or by a contractor acting on Floream's behalf.

## Usage of open source

Include the following:

- [ ] Use of open source tools (e.g. build systems, interpreters), existing solutions (e.g. Moodle plugins) and libraries (e.g. jQuery and accompanying plugins)
- [ ] Patches to such software should be released upstream or at least made publicly available in the hope that they're useful to others

## Benefits to Floream

Include the following:

- [ ] Lower overheads on new developments, as we're able to derive our work from existing projects
- [ ] Possible lead in to lower overheads on maintenance, as our changes can be incorporated upstream
- [ ] Reusability
- [ ] Community involvement/wide base of ideas
- [ ] Wider audience for auditing the source for security and stability vulnerabilities

## Criteria for release

- [ ] Code review and appropriate modifications
- [ ] Do we make a distinction between projects we've already done work on and projects going forwards?

## Community participation

Include the following:

- [ ] Time allowance for triaging issues and pull requests and communicating the roadmap for our developments to our users
- [ ] How we handle issues and pull requests for functionality we consider out of scope

## Licensing

Include the following:

- [ ] GPL for Moodle components, as it's a requirement of the GPL v3 under which the core of the platform is licensed
- [ ] CLA for contributions from the community to clearly identify ownership and rights to fair use

## Exceptions

Include the following:

- [ ] Themes containing branding are exempt from release. This does not include base/framework themes, which are specifically designed to exclude branding
